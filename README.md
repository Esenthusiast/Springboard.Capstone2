# Problem
Recent history has shown a change in the job market, for many working professionals not only is the life-time career position gone, but careers are made of freelance and contract work, the share economy has already begun (and has promised to continue) to change how services are exchanged, and a prolonged recession with social-economic turmoil has changed how previous generations and raising generations think about the Job market. Therefore, with all this in mind I want to consider and investigate how the job market has changed. 
How have the amount (pure number) and fraction of jobs in different industries shifted? Especially industries with widly different ranges of salaries and available employment? Such as traditional desk jobs (office admin, and management) compared to technical or industrial jobs.  

Finally, how have salaries, especially the most extreme salaries shifted over the last 5-10 years, especially when considered alongside national and regional GDP/ recession economic data. 

# The Data
For my data I am using two data sources: 
First, the GDP and national economic information isolated from The World Bank website w/ USA data from 1961 until 2016.
Second, salary and job listing data from the National Labor Board listing salaries/wages (hourly and annual) by job type, overall employment numbers and salary distribution for different job/career categories.

# Current Questions

-- How have the amount (pure number) and fraction of jobs including titles associates with different stages of employment shifted? That is entry level, mid levels and high level? I will consider that question by looking at job titles. And how have those salaries changed? 

-- Have the salaries for the different types of jobs (technical vs. service industry) and different levels (entry level vs. management vs. CEO)  changed at the same rate? If not, which have changed more, and at what rates?

-- How have salaries, especially salaries across entry, middle and high level jobs, shifted over the last 5-10 years, especially when considered alongside national and regional GDP/ recession economic data?

# Who Cares and Why?

The economic market has been undergoing a variety of changes over the last 20 years. The recession did not change the overall market, but this recession is unique within economic forcasts and will teach us more about future economic shifts then past recessions- for job seekers, employers, and economists. 

- Job seekers need ot understand that although this data is not purly predictive, as the market is still adjusting t othe raise in online marketplaces, change in automation, and shifting world market- it can help give a glimpse at what industries will recover faster and be a better long-term consideration through future economic turmoil.

-- Employeers can understand better how market forces like the recession shift the demand and supply curve, requiring employeers to offer wage increases and other incentives in response to varying pressures. 

-- Economists and social scientists can use trends identified in this data set to help consider alongside other data on overall social changes in our job market.
