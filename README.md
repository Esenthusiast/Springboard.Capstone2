# Problem
Recent history has shown a change in the job market, for many working professionals not only is the life-time career position gone, but careers are made of freelance and contract work, the share economy has already begun (and has promised to continue) to change how services are exchanged, and a prolonged recession with social-economic turmoil has changed how previous generations and raising generations think about the Job market. Therefore, with all this in mind I want to consider and investigate how the job market has changed. 
How have the amount (pure number) and fraction of jobs including titles associates with different stages of employment shifted? That is entry level, mid levels and high level? I will consider that question by looking at job titles. For example:  V.P., Associate, Assistant, Manager, Assistant-Manager, Junior, Senior etc. 
For job seekers, how have the search terms changed in response to this shift, are job seekers perhaps driving the change ( or responding to the change) in job title frequency and job types. Specifically, has the rate of freelance/ contract jobs changed vs. rate of search for freelance/contract jobs.
Finally, how have salaries, especially salaries across entry, middle and high level jobs, shifted over the last 5-10 years, especially when considered alongside national and regional GDP/ recession economic data. 

# The Data
For my data I am using two data sources: 
First, the GDP and national economic information isolated from The World Bank website w/ USA data from 1961 until 2016.
Second, salary and job listing data from the National Labor Board listing salaries/wages (hourly and annual) by job type, overall employment numbers and salary distribution for different job/career categories.

# Current Questions

-- How have the amount (pure number) and fraction of jobs including titles associates with different stages of employment shifted? That is entry level, mid levels and high level? I will consider that question by looking at job titles. And how have those salaries changed? 

-- Have the salaries for the different types of jobs (technical vs. service industry) and different levels (entry level vs. management vs. CEO)  changed at the same rate? If not, which have changed more, and at what rates?

-- How have salaries, especially salaries across entry, middle and high level jobs, shifted over the last 5-10 years, especially when considered alongside national and regional GDP/ recession economic data?
